# Overview
This project was created to help me learn the Java language.

With this software I wanted to be able to take a recipe and switch between Metric and Imperial measurement systems. My original scope included adding recipes,
but I scaled it back after trying to keep the project within a deadline of two weeks for learning the language and writin the program. I wanted to, and demonstrated
the use of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, Arrays, and Modified the program to read and write to a file.

# Development Environment
I used intelliJ for my IDE. It has been a very helpful tool for development, surpassing what I am used to with Visual Studio and VS Code. 
I used the default IntelliJ build system, not importing Maven or Gradle.

I did not run any special packages within my java program, but I did import several things from the io, nio and util libraries. Downloading to a program that can compile your 
program, such as intelliJ will be necessary to run this file.

# Future Work
* Add New Recipe Creation
* Shift from text file symbol decoding to convert from imperial to metric to a dynamic system that finds keywords and makes conversions even within text.
* Add GUI that allows user to select with mouse input instead of just typing to console
